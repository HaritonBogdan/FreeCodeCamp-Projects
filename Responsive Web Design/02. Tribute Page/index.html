            <h2>Here is a little bit about him...</h2>
            <p id="info"> Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter,
                dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant
                cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and
                fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson
                influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized
                complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the
                most awarded individual music artist in history.</p>
